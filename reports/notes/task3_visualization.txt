Task 3 – Visualisation Insights
- The 1–7 Aug 2013 overlay (`task3_fig1_timeseries_overlay.png`) shows PV peaking around noon while demand crests after 18:00, confirming that storage or load shifting is required to absorb surplus solar and cover evening imports.
- Demand and PV histograms with KDE (`task3_fig2_distributions.png`) reveal highly skewed PV output (75% of hours below 0.82 kW) versus a tighter demand band, informing realistic state-of-charge bounds for optimisation.
- Hourly demand boxplots (`task3_fig3_hourly_boxplot.png`) highlight the 18:00–21:00 risk window where variability and peak probability are greatest; this guides battery discharge scheduling and tariff-aware demand response.
- Correlation heatmap (`task3_fig4_correlation_heatmap.png`) confirms shortwave irradiance as the dominant PV driver (ρ = 0.68) and limited linear linkage between demand and weather, justifying separate modelling strategies for generation and load.
- Typical hourly profiles (`task3_fig5_typical_profiles.png`) contrast weekday versus weekend behaviour: weekday evening demand is ~0.15 kW higher while weekend PV availability is slightly elevated, supporting differentiated HEMS control policies.

Most Informative Visualisation
- The typical hourly profiles are the most actionable for HEMS decisions because they simultaneously expose PV-demand misalignment and quantify how patterns change across the week. This directly informs storage dispatch, EV charging, and appliance scheduling strategies aimed at maximising self-consumption.
