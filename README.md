## 📖 Project Overview

This project develops a complete energy data science pipeline for a **Home Energy Management System (HEMS)**.The tasks cover:

1. Data visualization and exploration
2. PV data cleaning and imputation
3. Feature engineering (time-based & weather-related)
4. Time series decomposition
5. ARMA-family statistical modeling
6. Advanced machine learning models
7. Forecasting with rolling evaluation on out-of-sample data
8. Exogenous models using engineered features
9. Optimal 24h storage control under PV_low and PV_high scenarios

The results will be:

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuel29102002/Energy_Data_Science.git
cd Energy_Data_Science
```

### 2. Activate your Anaconda environment

```bash
conda activate energy-ds  # replace with the environment you already created
```

Need a fresh environment?

```bash
conda create -n energy-ds python=3.10
conda activate energy-ds
```

### 3. Install the dependencies

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
# or, inside the environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **macOS note:** XGBoost requires the OpenMP runtime. Install it once with `brew install libomp` before running the notebooks or Dash app.

### 4. (Optional) expose the kernel to Jupyter

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name energy-ds --display-name "Python (energy-ds)"
```

### 5. Run Jupyter Lab

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### 6. Add the course datasets

Place the provided `train_252145.csv`, `forecast.csv`, and `optimisation.csv` files inside `data/raw/`. Placeholder files are already tracked so you can overwrite them when the real data arrives.

## ▶️ How to Run

### Initial Assessment & Planning

- Run `01_visualization.ipynb` to profile PV generation, demand, and price for Task 1.
- Use `02_project_planning.ipynb` for the lifecycle diagram (outputs in `reports/figures/`).
- Explore Task 3 visuals in `03_visualization.ipynb`; artefacts land in `reports/figures/` and `reports/tables/`.
- Interactive Plotly exports for the dashboard are stored under `reports/figures/interactive/`.

### PV Cleaning & Feature Prep

- Execute `04_pv_cleaning.ipynb` to audit PV sensor gaps and compare imputation strategies; figures/tables feed the report and dashboard.
- Use `05_feature_engineering.ipynb` and `06_ts_decomposition.ipynb` for derived features and decomposition analysis.

### Modeling

- Statistical ARMA-family models: `07_stats_models_ARMA.ipynb`
- Machine Learning model: `08_ml_models.ipynb`

### Forecasting

- Rolling 7-day forecasts on `forecast.csv`: `09_forecasting_pipeline.ipynb`
- Includes naive baselines and comparisons.

### Exogenous Models

- Enhanced models with exogenous features: `10_exogenous_models.ipynb`

### Optimization

- Battery storage optimization: `11_optim_storage.ipynb`
- Compares PV_low vs PV_high cases.

### Dash App

- Launch the interactive dashboard for exploratory analysis:

```bash
python src/dash_app/app.py
```

- Open the printed URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8050`). The **Overview** tab tracks key metrics, the **Visualisation Studio** tab provides interactive plot selection (timeseries, distributions, boxplots, heatmaps, profiles), the **Decomposition** tab shows STL components and typical profiles with seasonality strengths, the **PV Cleaning** tab compares imputation strategies with live overlays and summary tables, and the **Features** tab surfaces ranking tables and distributions on demand.

- Data cleaning comparison (PV_mod1 with 3 methods)
- Feature importance rankings
- Demand decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual) with typical weekday/weekend and monthly profiles
- ARIMA/SARIMA demand forecasts with whole-split and walk-forward evaluation metrics
- XGBoost demand forecasts with feature importance diagnostics and stat-model comparison
- Rolling 7-day forecast pipeline comparing ML, statistical, and naive baselines
- ARMA vs ML forecasting performance (normalized RMSE, MAE)
- Exogenous vs autoregressive models
- Optimal storage control decisions for 24h horizon
